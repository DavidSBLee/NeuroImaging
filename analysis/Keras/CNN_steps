Steps of CNN
(Potential Pre-Steap)
Either
0. Resize DICOMS to 10 x 10 x 1 then covert to niftis
or 
0. Separate NIFTIs, resize them, then remerge them 


1. Get NIfTIs
1.1. Rename NIfTIs based on category (labeling)
2. Get Mayo Template
3. Resample Mayo
4. Choose one from A,B,C (for now )
5. Load to Numpy Array (May be scailing)
6. Create Label Array
6. Run it through CNN

A) Register NIfTIs to Mayo (end up with 1.5x1.5x1.5), then resize
B) Register NIfTIs to Resampled Mayo (end up with 1x1x1, 182x218x164), then resize
C) Register NIfTIs to Resized-Resampled Mayo

Resample - ANTs resmple function
Registration - Nilearn
Resize - I don't know... Nilearn, or CV2?

Can I use affine information??


Direct Downsampling - potentially lose a wealth of infomation



Keras Notes
border_mode has become padding, dim_ordering is data_format etc
